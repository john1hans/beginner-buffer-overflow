check the before.c you will see the  " char yourname[20]; "  20 thats ur limit to use chars if u will write ex. 44 chars you will get errors thats buffer overflow
chech the after.c and you will see " char yourname[1]; " whatever u will write ( ex. john > 4 chars ) you will get error cuz char yourname char limit is 1 u can only write like a ( n  or  m ) like that.
